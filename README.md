# DynamicFinder
A DLL sideloading utility.

DynamicFinder will search every running process for DLL sideloading opportunities.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/analyticsearch/DynamicFinder.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DynamicFinder
   ```

## Usage

Build and run the project using the following commands:

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build
